Cryptlib
Cryptlib is an open-source, cross-platform software security toolkit designed for building cryptographic security into applications. It provides a wide range of cryptographic operations including encryption, digital signatures, secure data transport, and more.
Cryptlib is distributed under the Sleepycat License, which is compatible with the GNU General Public License (GPL). It is also available under a commercial license for proprietary use.
Recent updates have focused on expanding support for modern cryptographic algorithms like AES-GCM, Curve25519, and improved support for secure multi-party computations. Cryptlib offers APIs that make it suitable for embedding cryptographic functions in mobile, web, and server applications.
Crypto++
Crypto++ (also known as CryptoPP, libcrypto++, and libcryptopp) is a widely-used, free and open-source C++ library of cryptographic algorithms, written by Wei Dai. It supports a comprehensive suite of cryptographic primitives and schemes, including block ciphers (AES, DES), stream ciphers, public-key cryptography (RSA, DSA, ECC), and various hash functions (SHA-256, SHA-3).
Crypto++ is frequently used in research and industry projects. It is maintained actively, with recent enhancements including support for newer encryption standards like ChaCha20-Poly1305, BLAKE3 hashing, and the EdDSA signature algorithm.
The library emphasizes high performance and portability, making it a preferred choice for C++ developers in security-sensitive applications.
LibreSSL
LibreSSL is an open-source implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, developed by the OpenBSD project. It was forked from OpenSSL in 2014 in response to the Heartbleed vulnerability, with the goal of modernizing the codebase, improving security, and reducing complexity.
LibreSSL has focused on removing obsolete features and improving code quality. It no longer includes deprecated cryptographic algorithms like SSLv2/SSLv3 and MD5, focusing on secure, modern standards like TLS 1.3, SHA-3, and Ed25519.
Recent updates have included enhancements in cryptographic algorithm support, better random number generation, and improved performance on modern CPU architectures. It remains popular among UNIX-like systems for providing secure communication channels.
OpenSSL
Description: OpenSSL is one of the most widely used open-source libraries for implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. It also provides a comprehensive suite of cryptographic functions, including public-key cryptography, symmetric encryption, and hashing algorithms.
Updates: OpenSSL 3.0 introduced a new "Provider" architecture that allows for better flexibility in integrating cryptographic algorithms. It also includes improved support for post-quantum cryptography, ChaCha20-Poly1305, and updated TLS 1.3 support.
Use Cases: Secure web communication (HTTPS), VPNs, and cryptographic operations in software applications.
PyCryptodome
Description: PyCryptodome is a self-contained Python package of low-level cryptographic primitives. It is a fork of the old PyCrypto library and includes many improvements and additional features such as support for AES, RSA, DSA, and hash functions.
Updates: The latest versions have improved support for AES-GCM, RSA-PSS signatures, and hardware-accelerated encryption on modern processors.
Use Cases: Cryptographic operations in Python-based projects, such as secure file encryption and digital signatures.
Tink (by Google)
Description: Tink is an open-source cryptographic library developed by Google. It provides easy-to-use and secure APIs for cryptographic operations such as encryption, digital signatures, and key management. Tink aims to make cryptography safer and simpler for developers.
Updates: Tink now supports hybrid encryption schemes, better integration with cloud key management services (e.g., Google Cloud KMS, AWS KMS), and enhanced support for AES-SIV for misuse-resistant encryption.
Use Cases: Secure application development, cloud-based encryption, and secure data storage.
